The system provides a web based library that grants user access to an online platform, and intends to investigate the effectiveness of high level automation library system by monitoring user’s satisfaction and behaviour using Google Analytics. Google Analytics shows high level dashboard data type for casual users and in-depth data for report set. It includes Google website optimizer rebranded as Google analytics content experiments. The newer version of Google Analytics tracking code is known as the asynchronous tracking code, which Google claims is significantly more sensitive and accurate, and is able to track even very short activities on the website. The Web based library system’s main idea is to implement a network based application for uploading, downloading required information for research and request for books or materials through online application. In this case we use Google analytics to capture user’s data. In addition to collecting data for navigation to this content through the website, our acquisitions staff are using this data to evaluate which databases and digital content need to be kept.
